GreenBeretGBA V0.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Green Beret, Rush'n Attack & Mr. Goemon - Arcade emulator for the GBA.
It has bugs in the sprite rendering and no tile priority support.
You should still be able to enjoy the game though. =)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now put gberet.zip, rushatck.zip and/or mrgoemon.zip into a folder where you
have arcade roms.

When the emulator starts, you can press L+R to open up the menu (the emulator
tries to load Green Beret automagically on startup).
Now you can use the cross to navigate the menus, A to select an option, B to go
back a step.
